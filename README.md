# Deep-Learning-Azure-Deployment
This repository can be used as a starting point to build your basic Deep Learning classification model on the IRIS dataset and deploy it on the cloud using Azure

# Dataset
The dataset used for this model is the [IRIS dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) and the model is capable to classify input data into one of the three classes

# Model Notebook
The code for a basic sequential model using tensorflow is within the notebook [IRIS.ipynb](https://github.com/shubanms/DL-Azure-Deployment/blob/main/IRIS.ipynb)

# Deployment
The code for connecting to Azure and then load in the model locally for testing is within the notebook [Azure_Model_Deployment.ipynb](https://github.com/shubanms/DL-Azure-Deployment/blob/main/Azure_Model_Deployment.ipynb)

# Installing and Use
If you have git set-up locally then fork the repository first then clone it to your local machine, if not then you can download the whole repository as a zip file and extract all the notebooks and the files from it
